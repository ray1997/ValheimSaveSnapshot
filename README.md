### Usage
After start a program, select profile on a left (If no profile exist than that's mean you never played Valheim before)

Available snapshots of selected profile will show on right side. 
Right click on empty space to add more snapshots, 
otherwise right click on item to manage that snapshot.

On snapshot item, there will be a flag icon on the item itself. That is a snapshot that is very recently made or restored to game save.
